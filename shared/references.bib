IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.},

We propose a new kind of virtual overlay network (VON) that overcomes this deficiency and can be constructed using only simple extensions of existing network technology. In this paper, we use the restructured electric power grid to illustrate the issues, and elaborate on the technical implications of our proposal.},

They can secure, in plain sight, all kinds of transactions ---such as titles, sales, and payments--- in the exact order in which they occur. Public ledgers not only curb corruption, but also enable very sophisticated applications ---such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. They stand to revolutionize the way a democratic society operates. As currently implemented, however, they scale poorly and cannot achieve their potential. Algorand is a truly democratic and efficient way to implement a public ledger. Unlike prior implementations based on proof of work, it requires a negligible amount of computation, and generates a transaction history that will not "fork" with overwhelmingly high probability. Algorand is based on (a novel and super fast) message-passing Byzantine agreement. For concreteness, we shall describe Algorand only as a money platform.},

This paper shows the details of a service-oriented virtual community overlay network designed for secure external service orchestration. It can also provide contracted QoS guarantees that will definitely affect the overall performance of ubiquitous applications. Further, it highlights the working principle of access control policies as well as a service behavior monitoring mechanism using an example scenario.},

  abstract = {Existing package and system configuration management tools suffer from an imperative model, where system administration actions such as package upgrades or changes to system configuration files are stateful: they destructively update the state of the system. This leads to many problems, such as the inability to roll back changes easily, to deploy multiple versions of a package side-by-side, to reproduce a configuration deterministically on another machine, or to reliably upgrade a system. In this article we show that we can overcome these problems by moving to a purely functional system configuration model. This means that all static parts of a system (such as software packages, configuration files and system startup scripts) are built by pure functions and are immutable, stored in a way analogous to a heap in a purely functional language. We have implemented this model in NixOS, a non-trivial Linux distribution that uses the Nix package manager to build the entire system configuration from a modular, purely functional specification.},

  abstract = {WireGuard is a secure network tunnel, operating at layer 3, implemented as a kernel virtual network interface for Linux, which aims to replace both IPsec for most use cases, as well as popular user space and/or TLS-based solutions like OpenVPN, while being more secure, more performant, and easier to use. The virtual tunnel interface is based on a proposed fundamental principle of secure tunnels: an association between a peer public key and a tunnel source IP address. It uses a single round trip key exchange, based on NoiseIK, and handles all session creation transparently to the user using a novel timer state machine mechanism. Short pre-shared static keys—Curve25519 points—are used for mutual authentication in the style of OpenSSH. The protocol provides strong perfect forward secrecy in addition to a high degree of identity hiding. Transport speed is accomplished using ChaCha20Poly1305 authenticated-encryption for encapsulation of packets in UDP. An improved take on IP-binding cookies is used for mitigating denial of service attacks, improving greatly on IKEv2 and DTLS’s cookie mechanisms to add encryption and authentication. The overall design allows for allocating no resources in response to received packets, and from a systems perspective, there are multiple interesting Linux implementation techniques for queues and parallelism. Finally, WireGuard can be simply implemented for Linux in less than 4,000 lines of code, making it easily audited and verified.},

  abstract = {The growth of the Internet and its popular services are forcing telecom operators to provide advanced services to their subscribers, as traditional voice services are no longer enough to attract more customers. To enable more innovative and value-added IP services and take advantage of the services that the Internet provides, the IP Multimedia Subsystem(IMS) is introduced. The IMS provides a complete access-agnostic architecture and framework that facilitates the convergence of the mobile network, removing the gap between the two most successful communication networks that are the cellular and the Internet network. The harmonized All-IP platform has the potential to provide all Internet services with a more cost-effective and more efficient architecture than the circuit-switched networks do. However, by merging two of the most successful networks, the integration of two network models with different concerns and motivations is not without its problems, among which the scalability issue is the most essential, when supporting content delivery services. The purpose of this chapter is to study and design a new content delivery network infrastructure, PeerMob, merging the Peer-to-Peer technology with the IMS framework, which benefits IMS with scalability, reliability, and efficiency features coming with decentralized P2P architecture. The chapter also puts this P2P IMS paradigm under realistic network conditions and strenuous simulation to evaluate the performance of the P2P IMS system.},

It is the first scheme for which the performance is optimal in the sense that time and communication complexity is minimal both for the individual voters and the authorities. An interesting property of the scheme is that the time and communication complexity for the voter is independent of the number of authorities. A voter simply posts a single encrypted message accompanied by a compact proof that it contains a valid vote. Our result is complementary to the result by Cramer, Franklin, Schoenmakers, and Yung in the sense that in their scheme the work for voters is linear in the number of authorities but can be instantiated to yield information-theoretic privacy, while in our scheme the voter’s effort is independent of the number of authorities but always provides computational privacy-protection. We will also point out that the majority of proposed voting schemes provide computational privacy only (often without even considering the lack of information-theoretic privacy), and that our new scheme is by far superior to those schemes.},

We present a new construction for PVSS schemes, which compared to previous solutions by Stadler and later by Fujisaki and Okamoto, achieves improvements both in efficiency and in the type of intractability assumptions. The running time is O(nk), where k is a security parameter, and n is the number of participants, hence essentially optimal. The intractability assumptions are the standard Diffie-Hellman assumption and its decisional variant. We present several applications of our PVSS scheme, among which is a new type of universally verifiable election scheme based on PVSS. The election scheme becomes quite practical and combines several advantages of related electronic voting schemes, which makes it of interest in its own right.},

  author = {Ii, Grant M Callant},
  abstract = {Currently, passwords are the default method used to authenticate users. As hardware continues to advance in speed, breaking these passwords becomes easier. The traditional solution to this problem is ever increasing password complexity and two-factor authentication. However, users become strained under overly complex login systems and often circumvent them. Two-factor authentication also adds to this complexity and many forms of two-factor authentication are inherently insecure. In answer to these problems, this project proposes a password-less multi-factor authentication system, which leverages the tried-and-proven existing technologies, asymmetric cryptography, digital signatures, and biometric authentication. Simulated user testing shows promising results, suggesting that registration can be completed in just over thirty seconds, and authentication in just over two seconds. An analysis of this project’s possible attack vectors, preventative steps taken, and their solutions in potential future research are also discussed.},

It is therefore crucial to understand the relation between underlay and overlay networks and to characterize the behavior of real users with regard to the Internet. For this purpose, we have designed and implemented MULTIPROBE, a framework for large-scale P2P file-sharing measurements. Using this framework, we have performed measurements of BitTorrent, which is currently the P2P file sharing network with the largest amount of Internet traffic. We analyze and correlate these measurements to provide new insights into the topology, the connectivity, and the path characteristics of the Internet parts underlying P2P networks, as well as to present unique information on the BitTorrent throughput and connectivity.},

It includes a brief description of each RFC, along with background information explaining the motivation and context of IPsec's outgrowths and extensions. It obsoletes RFC 2411, the previous "IP Security Document Roadmap." The obsoleted IPsec roadmap (RFC 2411) briefly described the interrelationship of the various classes of base IPsec documents. The major focus of RFC 2411 was to specify the recommended contents of documents specifying additional encryption and authentication algorithms.

  abstract = {Innføring av skivedeling i 5G nettverk åpner for at vertikale virksomheter kan utvikle og benytte sine tjenester ved siden av hverandre i telenett. Sammenliknet med tidligere generasjons mobilnettverk, søker 5G å kunne tilby flere tjenester simultant. Programvaredefinerte Nettverk (SDN) og Virtualiserte Nettverksfunksjoner (NFV) er, ved å innføre nødvendig fleksibilitet til å deployere nettverksfunksjoner og koble de sammen i ønsket rekkefølge, to hovedteknologier for å kunne lage kjeder av tjenestefunksjoner dynamisk med felles infrastruktur.     Sikkerhet er en av utfordringene med å ha en delt nettverks- og prosesseringsinfrastruktur. Tunnelering gjennom Virtuelle Private Nettverk (VPN) er et sikkerhetstiltak som kan iverksettes av den skiveansvarlige for å skille nettverksskiver, tjenester og funksjoner fra hverandre.  Vi har studert hvordan WireGuard kan brukes som VPN tilbyder for å skape en kryptert tunnel som en tjeneste mellom nettverksfunksjoner. Open Source MANO (OSM) er brukt som programvare for å kombinere og orkestrere  nettverksfunksjoner til nettverkstjenester og nettverkskiver. For å simulere reelle mobilnettverk har vi designet og testet flere scenarioer. WireGuard har blitt lagt til som VPN som en tjeneste i de ulike situasjonene for å isolere og sikre trafikken mellom nettverksfunksjoner. Gjennom utvkling i oppgaven har vi kommet opp med et konsept for å implementere en WireGuard som en tjeneste der vi bruker minimalt med manuelle steg. For å redusere manuelle steg i oppsett og konfigurasjon av WireGuard har vi brukt den innebygde Juju kontrolleren i OSM.  Etter å ha deployert nettverkstjenestene vi har utviklet til en delt infrastruktur har vi gjort målinger for å studere hvordan WireGuard påvirker ytelsen. Vi har målt en gjennomstrømning på mellom 0.8 Gbps og 2.5 Gbps og forsinkelse på under 1 ms ved bruk av WireGuard-tunneler mellom nettverksfunksjoner. Målingene vi har gjort ligger innenfor flere av nøkkeltallsindikatorene for 5G nettverk. Det gjør WireGuard passende for å brukes til å tilføre sikkerhet for isolering av nettverksskiver i utviklingen av 5G nettverk og kommende teknologier.},

  abstract = {Secure multi-party computation (MPC) allows parties to perform computations on data while keeping that data private. This capability has great potential for machine-learning applications: it facilitates training of machine-learning models on private data sets owned by different parties, evaluation of one party's private model using another party's private data, etc. Although a range of studies implement machine-learning models via secure MPC, such implementations are not yet mainstream. Adoption of secure MPC is hampered by the absence of flexible software frameworks that "speak the language" of machine-learning researchers and engineers. To foster adoption of secure MPC in machine learning, we present CrypTen: a software framework that exposes popular secure MPC primitives via abstractions that are common in modern machine-learning frameworks, such as tensor computations, automatic differentiation, and modular neural networks. This paper describes the design of CrypTen and measure its performance on state-of-the-art models for text classification, speech recognition, and image classification. Our benchmarks show that CrypTen's GPU support and high-performance communication between (an arbitrary number of) parties allows it to perform efficient private evaluation of modern machine-learning models under a semi-honest threat model. For example, two parties using CrypTen can securely predict phonemes in speech recordings using Wav2Letter faster than real-time. We hope that CrypTen will spur adoption of secure MPC in the machine-learning community.},

Prior to 2010, the focus of information exchange in the NwHIN was the Regional Health Information Organization (RHIO). Since 2010, the Office of the National Coordinator (ONC) has been sponsoring policies that promote an internetlike architecture that encourages point to-point information exchange and private health information exchange networks. The net effect of these activities is to undercut the limited business model for RHIOs, decreasing the likelihood of their success, while making the NwHIN dependent on nascent technologies for community level functions such as record locator services. These changes may impact the health of patients and communities. Independent, scientifically focused debate is needed on the wisdom of ONC’s proposed changes in its strategy for the NwHIN.},

Recently, MPC has become efficient enough to be used in practice, and has made the transition from an object of theoretical study to a technology being used in industry. In this article, we will review what MPC is, what problems it solves, and how it is being currently used. We note that the examples and references brought in this review article are far from comprehensive, and due to the lack of space many highly relevant works are not cited.},

  abstract = {BitTorrent nowadays is one of the most popular peer-to-peer (P2P) applications on the Internet; on the other hand, network address translation (NAT) has become pervasive in almost all networking scenarios. Despite the effort of NAT traversal, it is still very likely that P2P applications cannot receive incoming connection requests properly if they are behind NAT. Although this phenomenon has been widely observed, so far there is no quantitative study in the literature examining the impact of NAT on P2P applications. In this paper, we build analytical models to capture the performance of BitTorrent-like P2P systems with the presence of homogeneous and heterogeneous NAT peers. We further propose biased optimistic unchoke strategies in order to improve the overall system performance considerably. The analytical models have been validated by simulation results, which also reveal some interesting facts about the coexistence of NAT and public peers in P2P systems.},

This new name space consists of cryptographic identifiers, thereby implementing the so-called identifier / locator split. In the new architecture, the new identifiers are used in naming application level end-points (sockets), replacing the prior identification role of IP addresses in applications, sockets, TCP connections, and UDP-based send and receive system calls. IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are still used, but only as names for topological locations in the network. HIP can be deployed such that no changes are needed in applications or routers. Almost all pre-compiled legacy applications continue to work, without modifications, for communicating with both HIP-enabled and non-HIP-enabled peer hosts.},

  abstract = {Although multiple definitions of the DevOps concept exist, DevOps is generally considered to be an Agile software development approach with the goal of combining development and operations and emphasizing frequent and fast software deployment. Four main aspects of DevOps are collaboration, automation, measurement and monitoring. While the DevOps approach offers great benefits, many companies are struggling with the implementation of DevOps and with maintaining control of their processes due to the required autonomy of the DevOps teams and the high degree of automation. At the same time, they struggle with demonstrating this control towards external auditing parties. This study therefore seeks to identify which types of risks companies using DevOps are generally exposed to and to develop a framework that helps companies control their processes and manage risks without hindering the speed and efficiency of the DevOps approach substantially. The literature review suggests that many risk management controls concerning access management, change management, compliance and security can be automated. However, research on DevOps is still scarce and specific risks applicable to DevOps are hardly mentioned. Furthermore, we conducted case studies in nine companies using DevOps which show that manners of implementing DevOps differ widely and that many companies in practice use a combination of traditional and automated controls to manage their DevOps environment. This study also shows that soft aspects such as organizational culture, communication and team responsibility are of integral importance for effectively mitigating risks in DevOps. Risks associated with DevOps can be grouped into five categories which are transitional, organizational, project, team and product risks. It is further argued that there is no best way to implement DevOps and that the DevOps concept rather needs to be tailored to the needs of the company in question. Two main factors that influence companies in their decision how to manage their processes are the DevOps maturity and risk appetite. Based on these factors, a framework is developed that suggests four strategies with suitable controls to manage risks in DevOps. The findings of this study implicate that companies first have to find a way to establish a solid DevOps culture before relying on automation practices. Likewise, auditors will have to find a way to assess these so-called "soft controls" in order to reliably give assurance on internal control. This thesis presents some first suggestions on how this can be done.},

  abstract = {Overlay routing enhances the reliability and performance of IP networks since it can bypass network congestion and transient outages by forwarding traffic through one or more intermediate overlay nodes. In this paper, two algorithms for multicast applications in service overlay networks are presented. The first algorithm is tailored for source-specific applications such as live video, software and file distribution, replicated database, web site replication, and periodic data delivery; it builds a virtual source-rooted multicast tree to allow one member in the multicast group to send data to the other members. The second algorithm is tailored for group-shared applications such as videoconference, distributed games, file sharing, collaborative groupware, and replicated database; it constructs a virtual shared tree among group members. The objective of both algorithms is to achieve traffic balancing on the overlay network so as to avoid traffic congestion and fluctuation on the underlay network, which cause low performance. To address these problems, the algorithms actively probe the underlay network and compute virtual multicast trees by dynamically selecting the least loaded available paths on the overlay network. This way, network resources are optimally distributed and the number of multicast trees that can be setup is maximized. Both algorithms can offer service differentiation, i.e., provide QoS at application-layer without IP-layer support. The low computational complexity of the proposed algorithms leads to time and resource saving, as shown through extensive simulation experiments.},

ERGO aims to balance the overloaded nodes by rewiring some of their incoming links to underloaded ones via a set of interconnected servers which index the underloaded nodes. In two simulated environments, ERGO load-balancing on Gnutella network increases the balanced nodes and network availability by preserving its efficiency and even reducing its messages.},

  abstract = {The Internet is a critical resource in the day-to-day life of billions of users. To support the growing number of users and their increasing demands, operators have to continuously scale their network footprint -- e.g., by joining Internet Exchange Points -- and adopt relevant technologies -- such as IPv6. IPv6, however, has a vastly larger address space compared to its predecessor, which allows for new kinds of attacks on the Internet routing infrastructure. In this paper, we revisit prefix de-aggregation attacks in the light of these two changes and introduce Kirin -- an advanced BGP prefix de-aggregation attack that sources millions of IPv6 routes and distributes them via thousands of sessions across various IXPs to overflow the memory of border routers within thousands of remote ASes. Kirin's highly distributed nature allows it to bypass traditional route-flooding defense mechanisms, such as per-session prefix limits or route flap damping. We analyze the theoretical feasibility of the attack by formulating it as a Integer Linear Programming problem, test for practical hurdles by deploying the infrastructure required to perform a small-scale Kirin attack using 4 IXPs, and validate our assumptions via BGP data analysis, real-world measurements, and router testbed experiments. Despite its low deployment cost, we find Kirin capable of injecting lethal amounts of IPv6 routes in the routers of thousands of ASes.},

This information is sufficient for constructing a graph of AS connectivity for this reachability from which routing loops may be pruned, and, at the AS level, some policy decisions may be enforced. BGP-4 provides a set of mechanisms for supporting Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR). These mechanisms include support for advertising a set of destinations as an IP prefix, and eliminating the concept of network "class" within BGP. BGP-4 also introduces mechanisms that allow aggregation of routes, including aggregation of AS paths. This document obsoletes RFC 1771. [STANDARDS-TRACK]},

  abstract = {As ISPs face IPv4 address scarcity they increasingly turn to network address translation (NAT) to accommodate the address needs of their customers. Recently, ISPs have moved beyond employing NATs only directly at individual customers and instead begun deploying Carrier-Grade NATs (CGNs) to apply address translation to many independent and disparate endpoints spanning physical locations, a phenomenon that so far has received little in the way of empirical assessment. In this work we present a broad and systematic study of the deployment and behavior of these middleboxes. We develop a methodology to detect the existence of hosts behind CGNs by extracting non-routable IP addresses from peer lists we obtain by crawling the BitTorrent DHT. We complement this approach with improvements to our Netalyzr troubleshooting service, enabling us to determine a range of indicators of CGN presence as well as detailed insights into key properties of CGNs. Combining the two data sources we illustrate the scope of CGN deployment on today's Internet, and report on characteristics of commonly deployed CGNs and their effect on end users.},

  abstract = {We present a decentralized hole punching mechanism built into the peer-to-peer networking library libp2p [1]. Hole punching is crucial for peer-to-peer networks, enabling each participant to directly communicate to any other participant, despite being separated by firewalls and NATs. The decentralized libp2p hole punching protocol leverages protocols similar to STUN (RFC 8489 [2]), TURN (RFC 8566 [3]) and ICE (RFC 8445 [4]), without the need for any centralized infrastructure. Specifically, it doesn’t require any previous knowledge about network participants other than at least one (any arbitrary) node to bootstrap peer discovery. The key insight is that the protocols used for hole punching, namely address discovery and relaying protocols, can be built such that their resource requirements are negligible. This makes it feasible for any participant in the network to run these, thereby enabling the coordination of hole punch attempts, assuming that at least a small fraction of nodes is not located behind a firewall or a NAT.},

  abstract = {If a host is located behind a NAT, it can be impossible for that host to communicate directly with other hosts (peers) in certain situations. In these situations, it is necessary for the host to use the services of an intermediate node that acts as a communication relay. This specification defines a protocol, called "Traversal Using Relays around NAT" (TURN), that allows the host to control the operation of the relay and to exchange packets with its peers using the relay. TURN differs from other relay control protocols in that it allows a client to communicate with multiple peers using a single relay address. The TURN protocol was designed to be used as part of the Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE) approach to NAT traversal, though it can also be used without ICE. This document obsoletes RFCs 5766 and 6156.},

@article{vilanovaNextGenerationOverlay,
  title = {Next {{Generation Overlay Networks}}: {{Security}}, {{Trust}}, and {{Deployment Challenges}}},
  author = {Vilanova, Jordi Paillisse and Aparicio, Albert Cabellos},
  abstract = {Overlay networks are a technique to build a new network on top of an existing one. They are a key tool to add functionality to existing networks, and are used in different layers of the Internet stack for a wide variety of purposes, like confidentiality, Quality of Service, virtual networking, etc. Specifically, network overlays in the IP networking layer are widely used in some of these use cases. However, these kind of overlay networks do not have as many functionalities as overlays in other layers. For example, thanks to the Zero Trust Networking paradigm it is possible to build secure overlay networks at L7 using HTTPS. Taking this into account, this thesis strives to add new features and improve on others of IP overlay networks, in order to support emerging challenges. This thesis focuses on three axes: security, trust, and deployment in enterprise scenarios. First, regarding security, we explore how to simplify the setup of secure tunnels over the Internet, without relying on external Public Key Infrastructure or proprietary solutions. To this purpose, we leverage WireGuard, a state of the art VPN protocol, and add a control plane on top of it to distribute encryption keys. In addition, we present the implementation of a prototype and a performance evaluation. Second, with respect to trust, we investigate how emerging blockchain technology can be used in distributed mapping systems. Mapping systems are a database used in some overlay network deployments to assist in the creation of tunnels, by storing overlay to underlay pairs of addresses. Mapping systems are not commonly used in scenarios with multiple administrative domains, due to configuration complexity and centralized control. We explore how some of the properties of blockchains, such as distributed control, or auditability, can help in building these type of mapping systems. We take into account both the policy aspects, that is, the advantages of a distributed trust scheme, and the technical ones, like simplified management. In addition, we present two deployment scenarios: one to increase the security of BGP-based inter-domain routing, and a set of cooperating companies that want to establish communications among themselves. Finally, we focus on the deployment of enterprise networks leveraging overlay networks. First, we discuss the challenges present in current enterprise networks, such as segmentation, mobility, or simplified operations. Then, we present a design based on overlay networks and SDN principles to address them, along with an evaluation of two real-life deployments. We conclude with a design tailored for future enterprise networks, based also on overlay networks and a layered approach. This solution aims to provide mobility, multi-homing, confidentiality, user and application identity, and access control policies for enterprise endpoints connected from any network, either in the campus or outside.},

While elegant from a theoretical perspective, those systems face difficulties under an open environment. Not only frequently joining and leaving of nodes generate enormous maintenance overhead, but also various behaviors and resources of peers compromise overlay performance and security. Instead of building P2P overlay from the theoretical view, this paper builds the overlay network from the perspective of the physical network. By combining different network topology-aware techniques, a distinctive overlay network that closely matches the Internet topology is constructed. The P2P system based on this structure is not only highly efficient for routing, but also keeps maintenance overhead very low even under highly dynamic environment. Moreover, the system provides a new aspect to solve many security issues.},

  abstract = {Secure multi-party computation (also known as secure computation, multi-party computation (MPC) or privacy-preserving computation) is a subfield of cryptography with the goal of creating methods for parties to jointly compute a function over their inputs while keeping those inputs private. Unlike traditional cryptographic tasks, where cryptography assures security and integrity of communication or storage and the adversary is outside the system of participants (an eavesdropper on the sender and receiver), the cryptography in this model protects participants' privacy from each other. The foundation for secure multi-party computation started in the late 1970s with the work on mental poker, cryptographic work that simulates game playing/computational tasks over distances without requiring a trusted third party. Note that traditionally, cryptography was about concealing content, while this new type of computation and protocol is about concealing partial information about data while computing with the data from many sources, and correctly producing outputs. By the late 1980s, Michael Ben-Or, Shafi Goldwasser and Avi Wigderson, and independently David Chaum, Claude Crépeau, and Ivan Damgård, had published papers showing "how to securely compute any function in the secure channels setting".},

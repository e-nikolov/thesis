# Internet protocol

This solution focuses on directly using the internet protocol without involving an overlay network. Our goal is to analyze the implications of using only the functionalities that MPyC directly supports to serve as the reference for our later experiments. 

## Implementation details

We will manually set up the multiparty computations via the public IP addresses of the machines and DNS.

## Performance analysis

## Security analysis

## Usability analysis

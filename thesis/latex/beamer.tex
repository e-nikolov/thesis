In this chapter we will provide a high level overview of the solutions
that will be analyzed in more detail in the following chapters. There is
a large body of existing protocols and applications that are relevant to
our problem of connecting the parties of a multiparty computation over
the internet. To make reviewing them easier, we will try to
approximately map them to the 7 layers of the OSI model, which will not
always be entirely accurate because many protocols and applications
implement aspects of several layers. The table below shows the layers at
which the protocols and network overlays appear to their users, but not
necessarily the layer at which their internals are implemented.

\caption{``Two parties behind separate NATs''\label{nat-intro}}
\end{figure}

As we mentioned in the introduction chapter, the devices in a typical
home network can only initiate connections to public endpoints (via
\gls{nat}) but cannot be discovered from outside their \gls{lan}. This
poses a challenge when two parties who want to communicate via a direct
link are both behind separate \glspl{nat} \ref{nat-intro} and neither
can be contacted by the other one first. Mesh \glspl{vpn} solve this
issue via \gls{nat} traversal techniques such as \gls{udp} hole punching
based on concepts from \gls{stun}. The machines of each party can
contact a public \gls{stun} server \ref{nat-traversal}, which will note
what \gls{ip} addresses the connections come from and inform the
parties. Since the parties initiated the connection to the STUN server,
their routers will keep a mapping between their local IP addresses and
the port that was allocated for the connection in order to be able to
forward the incoming traffic. Those ``holes'' in the NATs were
originally intended for the STUN server, but mesh VPNs use the stateless
``fire and forget'' UDP protocol for their internal communication, which
does not require nor provides a mechanism for the NATs to verify who
sent a UDP packet. With most NATs, this is enough to be able to (ab)use
the ``punched holes'' for the purpose of \gls{p2p} traffic from other
parties. Mesh VPNs implement the stateful \gls{tcp} and \gls{tls}
protocols on top of UDP and expose an regular network interface to the
other programs, keeping them shielded from the underlying complexities.
Other NAT implementations such as Symmetric NAT and \glspl{cgnat} can be
more difficult to ``punch through'' due to their more complex port
mapping strategies. In those cases, establishing P2P connections might
involve guess work or even fail and require falling back to routing the
(encrypted) traffic via another party or service.

\begin{block}{Traditional VPNs}
\protect\hypertarget{traditional-vpns}{}
\glspl{vpn} are implemented as Layer 2 or 3 network overlays. They are
commonly used for securely connecting machines from different
\glspl{lan}. They provide software emulation of a network interface
controller via a TUN/TAP driver on the operating system level and allow
other software to transparently use the functionality of the \gls{ip}
suite without requiring extra changes. Traditional \glspl{vpn} such as
IPSec\autocite{ipSecDocs} and OpenVPN\autocite{openVPNDocs} use a
centralized service that all (encrypted) client communications must pass
through. This introduces a single point of failure and a potential
bottleneck that might negatively impact the performance of the
multi-party computations due to their \gls{p2p} nature.
\end{block}

\begin{block}{WireGuard}
\protect\hypertarget{wireguard}{}
WireGuard\autocite{donenfeldWireGuardNextGeneration2017} is a more
recent protocol with a design informed by lessons learned from IPSec and
OpenVPN and a key management approach inspired by SSH. It is a lower
level protocol that focuses on configuration simplicity while network
topology, peer discovery and key distribution are left as a
responsibility of higher level systems that use it as a building block.
Wireguard is implemented as a Layer 3 overlay over UDP tunnels.
WireGuard has both user space implementations that use a TUN/TAP driver
and also has direct support built into the Linux Kernel since version
5.6 (May 2020). The kernel implementation allows for better performance
because it does not need to copy packets between the kernel and
user-space memory.

The snippets below show a minimal set of configuration options that need
to be provided in order for two peers to be able to form secure tunnels
with each other.

Each peer has a public/private key pair that is used for authentication
and encryption based on the Noise Protocol
Framework\autocite{noiseProtocol}. The \texttt{Address} field specifies
the virtual IP address that the local network interface will use, while
the \texttt{AllowedIPs} field specifies what virtual IP addresses are
associated with a peer's public key. A peer's \texttt{Endpoint} field
specifies the URL at which it can be reached. Only one of the peers must
be configured with a reachable endpoint for the other one. In the above
example once \texttt{peer1} initiates communication with \texttt{peer2},
\texttt{peer2} will learn the current endpoint of \texttt{peer1} and
will be able to communicate back with it.

\begin{block}{Mesh VPNs}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Tinc
\item
  N2N
\item
  Tailscale
\item
  Nebula
\item
  ZeroTier
\end{itemize}

Mesh \glspl{vpn} such as Tinc\autocite{tincDocs},
Tailscale\autocite{tailscaleDocs} and Nebula\autocite{nebulaDocs}
utilize NAT Traversal techniques in order to create direct \gls{p2p}
links between the clients for the data traffic. Authentication,
authorization and traffic encryption are performed using certificates
based on public key cryptography.

All three are open-source, with the exception of Tailscale's
coordination service which handles the peer discovery and identity
management. Headscale \autocite{fontJuanfontHeadscale2022} is a
community driven open-source alternative for that component. Tinc is the
oldest of the three but has a relatively small community. It is mainly
developed by a single author and appears to be more academic than
industry motivated. Nebula and Tailscale are both business driven.
Tailscale was started by a number of high profile ex-googlers and is the
most end-user focused of the three, providing a service that allows
people to sign up using a variety of identity providers including
Google, Microsoft, GitHub and others. They also provide an Admin console
that allows a user to easily add their personal devices to a network or
share them with others. It also has support for automation tools like
Terraform for creating authorization keys and managing an \gls{acl}
based firewall. Nebula was originally developed at the instant messaging
company Slack to create overlay networks for their cross region cloud
infrastructure, but the authors later started a new company and are
currently developing a user-centric platform similar to Tailscale's.
Nebula is more customizable than Tailscale and since it is completely
open-source it can be adapted to different use cases, but it is also
more involved to set up. A certificate authority needs to be configured
for issuing the identities of the participating hosts. Furthermore,
publicly accessible coordination servers need to be deployed to
facilitate the host discovery. Tailscale employs a distributed relay
network of \gls{derp} servers, while Nebula can be configured to route
via one of the other peers in the VPN.

\begin{frame}{Testing methodology}
\protect\hypertarget{testing-methodology}{}
In the following chapters we will design and implement several solutions
for ad hoc MPC sessions based on a subset of the previously discussed
related works: - Internet protocol - Wireguard - Tailscale - Headscale -
? Headscale with DID identity? - ? WebRTC? - Custom solution that
automates the wireguard configuration by visiting a web page

Additionally we will analyse and compare them in terms of performance,
security and usability

\begin{block}{Measuring performance}
\protect\hypertarget{measuring-performance}{}
During the preparation phase of the project we developed the \gls{e3}
framework which simplifies and automates the process of deploying
machines in different geographical regions, connecting them via an
overlay network and executing multiparty computations between them,
where each machine represents a different party.

To summarize, \gls{e3} is a set of scripts that use a number of
automation tools:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Terraform - declarative provisioning
\item
  NixOS - declarative Linux distribution
\item
  Colmena - declarative deployment for NixOS
\item
  PSSH - parallel execution of remote scripts over ssh
\item
  DigitalOcean - a cloud provider
\end{itemize}

It allows us to quickly provision cloud virtual machines in multiple
regions and reproducibly deploy all necessary software for running a
multiparty computation over a chosen network overlay solution. The
source code of \gls{e3} can be found on
\href{https://github.com/e-nikolov/mpyc}{GitHub}

Each solution will be deployed using the \gls{e3} framework and the
performance will be quantitatively measured in terms of the time it
takes to execute a number of MPyC demos. The selected demos have
different complexities in terms of communication rounds and message
sizes which will allow us to observe their impact on the overall
performance.

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Secret Santa - high round complexity with small messages
\item
  Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) MNIST classifier - low round
  complexity with large messages
\end{enumerate}

The demos will be configured at three different input size levels

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Low,
\item
  Medium
\item
  High
\end{itemize}

Furthermore, the demos will be executed in several networking scenarios:

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  1-10 parties in the same geographic region
\item
  1-10 parties evenly distributed across two nearby regions
\item
  1-10 parties evenly distributed across two distant regions
\item
  1-10 parties distributed across multiple distant regions
\end{enumerate}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Security}
\protect\hypertarget{security}{}
We will analyze aspects such as

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  key distribution
\item
  trust model - are there any trusted third parties and what would be
  the consequences if they are corrupted or breached
\item
  traffic encryption
\item
  identity strength
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

\begin{block}{Usability}
\protect\hypertarget{usability}{}
For each solution we will describe the steps that the parties need to
perform in order to execute a joint multiparty computation. Those steps
will be analyzed in terms of:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Complexity - how much technical expertise is expected from the parties
  in order to be able to execute the steps
\item
  Initial effort - how much effort is each party expected to put in
  preparing for their first joint computation
\item
  Repeated effort - after the initial setup, how much effort is required
  to perform another computation

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    with the same set of parties
  \item
    with another set of parties
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Finalization effort - how much effort is required to finalize the MPC
  session once it is complete and clean up any left-over artifacts or
  resources so that the machine of each party is in its original state
\end{itemize}
\end{block}

With tailscale each party needs to

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  register a Tailscale account
\item
  Download and install tailscale on the machine they want to run a
  multiparty computation
\item
  Run tailscale on their machine and logs into their account in order to
  link it to their own Tailnet
\item
  Share their Tailscale machine with the Tailnets of each of the other
  parties
\item
  Download the demo they want to run
\item
  Form the flags for running the chosen demo

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    add -P \$HOST:\$PORT for each party using their Tailscale
    hostname/virtual IP

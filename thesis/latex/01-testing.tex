During the preparation phase of the project we developed the \gls{e3}
framework which simplifies and automates the process of deploying
machines in different georgraphical regions, connecting them in an
overlay network and executing MPC computations between them, where each
machine represents a different party. During the thesis assignment we
will look at a number of solutions for ad hoc MPC sessions and compare
them in terms of performance, security and usability.

\hypertarget{performance}{%
\section{Performance}\label{performance}}

Each solution will be deployed using the \gls{e3} framework and the
performance will be quantitatively measured in terms of the speed of
execution of a number of pre-selected MPyC demos of different round
complexities and message sizes: - Secret santa - high round complexity -
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) MNIST classifier - low round
complexity, large message size

\hypertarget{security}{%
\section{Security}\label{security}}

We will analyze aspects such as - key distribution - trust model - are
there any trusted third parties and what would be the consequences if
they are corrupted or breached -

\hypertarget{usability}{%
\section{Usability}\label{usability}}

Each solution will be analyzed in terms of the actions that need to be
taken by the parties in order to perform a multiparty computation.

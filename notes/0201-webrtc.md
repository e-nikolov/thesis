## WebRTC
- Peer to peer communications for browsers
    - can also work without a browser
    - Mainly used for multimedia communications - Peer-to-peer Audio/Video/VoIP
- Spec - [https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/#persistent-information-exposed-by-webrtc)
- Uses STUN/TURN/ICE
- Data is encrypted
- Identity
    - Session Description Protocol (SDP)
    - peer certificates are generated and announced over SDP
    - ICE Candidates are negotiated for STUN/TURN connections
- Not a VPN
    - I think it canâ€™t serve as a TCP/IP network overlay that other applications can use
- Does not require additional plugins or native apps
- There seem to be many publicly available services that can be used as ICE servers for WebRTC

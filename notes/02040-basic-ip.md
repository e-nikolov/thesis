## Basic Internet Protocol solution

- Solution with 0 overhead to be used as a reference for the performance of the other solutions
- No encryption
- Requires public IP addresses or DNS
- Easy for us to create a demo for measuring the performance because we control all of the machines that represent the different parties
- In a real life scenario with separate parties that are not under a shared control, it will be difficult to use this solution because it requires a lot of manual configuration and coordination between the parties

### Session Traversal Utilities for NAT (STUN)
-  Uses a STUN server for discovery and UDP hole-punching
- Communications are peer-to-peer

### Traversal Using Relays around NAT (TURN)
- Peers use a relay server as a mediator to route traffic
### Interactive Connectivity Establishment (ICE)
- Umbrella term covering STUN/TURN and other related techniques

### Designated Encrypted Relay for Packets (DERP)
- TURN-like protocol by Tailscale
- Relaying encrypted Wireguard traffic over HTTP
- Routing based on the Peerâ€™s public key

## TOR

- The Onion Router has the concept of Onion Services, which receive an address under the .onion pseudo top level domain and correspond to a public key (e.g. vww6ybal4bd7szmgncyruucpgfkqahzddi37ktceo3ah7ngmcopnpyyd.onion)
- Can be used as a privacy layer in other solutions to hide the real IP addresses of the parties

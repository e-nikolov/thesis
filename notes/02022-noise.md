### Noise Protocol Framework

- Framework for building protocols
- Spec - [http://www.noiseprotocol.org/noise.pdf](http://www.noiseprotocol.org/noise.pdf)
- Suite of channel establishment protocols
- Similar to TLS
- Based on Elliptic-curve Diffieâ€“Hellman (ECDH) Handshakes
- Used in WhatsApp, Signal, Wireguard
- Resources:
    - Crypto Layers 
        - Low-level primitives - AES, ChaCha20.
        - Usefully combined primitives - AES-OCB, NaCl secretbox...
        - High-level protocols - TLS, Noise.
        - (sometimes) crypto spoken over the encrypted protocols, often for E2E crypto e.g. GPG over SMTPS, or CloudFlare blinded CAPTCHA tokens over HTTPS

	TLS (Transport Layer Security) and the Noise Protocol Framework are both cryptographic protocols that are used to secure communications over the internet. However, there are some key differences between the two protocols.
	
	Here are some of the main differences between TLS and the Noise Protocol Framework:
	
	1. Design Philosophy: TLS is designed to be a general-purpose protocol that can be used to secure a wide range of internet communications, including web browsing, email, and file transfers. The Noise Protocol Framework, on the other hand, is designed to be a lightweight, modular protocol that can be easily adapted to different use cases and network architectures.
	2. Cipher Suites: TLS supports a wide range of cipher suites, which are combinations of encryption algorithms and key exchange methods. The Noise Protocol Framework, on the other hand, supports only a few cipher suites that are designed to be secure and efficient.
	3. Handshake: The TLS handshake is a complex process that involves multiple rounds of communication between the client and server. The Noise Protocol Framework, on the other hand, has a simpler handshake process that involves only a few messages.
	4. Forward Secrecy: Both TLS and the Noise Protocol Framework support forward secrecy, which means that even if an attacker gains access to the secret keys used to encrypt communications, they cannot decrypt past communications. However, the way that forward secrecy is implemented in the two protocols is different.
	5. Adoption: TLS is widely adopted and supported by most internet applications and services. The Noise Protocol Framework is a newer protocol that is not yet as widely adopted, although it is gaining popularity in certain applications and communities.
	
	Overall, both TLS and the Noise Protocol Framework are effective ways to secure internet communications. The choice between the two protocols depends on factors such as the specific use case, the network architecture, and the desired level of security and efficiency.

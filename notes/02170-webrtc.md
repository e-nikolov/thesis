## WebRTC

- Peer to peer communications for browsers
    - can also work without a browser
    - Mainly used for multimedia communications - Peer-to-peer Audio/Video/VoIP
- Spec - [https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/](https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/#persistent-information-exposed-by-webrtc)
- Uses [nat](02021-internet-protocol.md) STUN/TURN/ICE
- Data is encrypted
- Privacy and Security Considerations
  - https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/#privacy-and-security-considerations
  - Revealing IP addresses
    - https://www.w3.org/TR/webrtc/#revealing-ip-addresses
    - For direct communication, the peer's IP addresses are shared
    - Possible to only use TURN servers
- Identity
    - Session Description Protocol (SDP)
    - peer certificates are generated and announced over SDP
    - ICE Candidates are negotiated for STUN/TURN connections
- Not a VPN
    - I think it canâ€™t serve as a TCP/IP network overlay that other applications can use
- Does not require additional plugins or native apps
- Perhaps it can be used with PyScript or WebAssembly to run MPyC programs in the browser?
- We could design a solution based on WebRTC in a browser by compiling the MPyC demos to web assembly or using PyScript.

- There seem to be many publicly available services that can be used as ICE servers for WebRTC

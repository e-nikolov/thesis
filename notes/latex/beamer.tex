  and the actual Solutions
\item
  The Test Framework is an engineering problem of its own which deals

  There is a huge amount of primitives and partial solutions that are
  relevant to our problem, which makes it difficult to review them all,

  one or two solutions per class while only briefly mentioning their
  alternatives

      Virtual Network Interface Controller - solutions that emulate a
      physical network controller in the OS using TUN/TAP driver. Most
      networked applications are already designed to work with the
      Internet Protocol Stack (Suite - definitions; Stack -
      implementations) in the host operating system and they do not need
      to do anything extra to work with a virtual NIC. Those solutions
      are usually more general purpose as they allow any other
      application on the host machine to use the overlay network.
      Installing an application that also uses this type of a solution
      may be unintuitive because it will essentially install 2 separate
      programs - the actual application and another one that manages the
      virtual network, while the virtual network will not be limited to
      our application but will also be usable by the others.

      Application layer - require the applications to be implemented in
      a way that supports the protocols of the solution by using
      additional libraries or SDKs to facilitate the communications.
      Those solutions result in more purpose built applications as it is
      not possible for an application to use the overlay network if it
      wasn't specifically designed to be able to.

\begin{description}
\item[ChatGPT]
:

TLS (Transport Layer Security) and the Noise Protocol Framework are both
cryptographic protocols that are used to secure communications over the
internet. However, there are some key differences between the two
protocols.

Here are some of the main differences between TLS and the Noise Protocol
Framework:

\begin{enumerate}
\tightlist
\item
  Design Philosophy: TLS is designed to be a general-purpose protocol
  that can be used to secure a wide range of internet communications,
  including web browsing, email, and file transfers. The Noise Protocol
  Framework, on the other hand, is designed to be a lightweight, modular
  protocol that can be easily adapted to different use cases and network
  architectures.
\item
  Cipher Suites: TLS supports a wide range of cipher suites, which are
  combinations of encryption algorithms and key exchange methods. The
  Noise Protocol Framework, on the other hand, supports only a few
  cipher suites that are designed to be secure and efficient.
\item
  Handshake: The TLS handshake is a complex process that involves
  multiple rounds of communication between the client and server. The
  Noise Protocol Framework, on the other hand, has a simpler handshake
  process that involves only a few messages.
\item
  Forward Secrecy: Both TLS and the Noise Protocol Framework support
  forward secrecy, which means that even if an attacker gains access to
  the secret keys used to encrypt communications, they cannot decrypt
  past communications. However, the way that forward secrecy is
  implemented in the two protocols is different.
\item
  Adoption: TLS is widely adopted and supported by most internet
  applications and services. The Noise Protocol Framework is a newer
  protocol that is not yet as widely adopted, although it is gaining
  popularity in certain applications and communities.
\end{enumerate}

Overall, both TLS and the Noise Protocol Framework are effective ways to
secure internet communications. The choice between the two protocols
depends on factors such as the specific use case, the network
architecture, and the desired level of security and efficiency.

  Easy for us to create a demo for measuring the performance because we
  control all of the machines that represent the different parties

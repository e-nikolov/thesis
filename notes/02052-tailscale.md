	- Tailnet per party
		- Parties have their own tailscale accounts and manage their own tailnet
		- Each party shares adds the machine they will use for MPC to their tailnet
		- They share that machine with the tailnets of the other parties
	- "Host" party manages a tailnet
		- The host party creates authorization keys for the machines of the other parties
		- Each party runs the tailscale client with their authorization key which lets them join the host party's tailnet

## OSI Model

- Create a figure that maps the various related components to OSI model layers
- It can be a "more or less accurate" artistic impression since the components can cover multiple layers and the layers are somewhat fluid

- Make a distinction between
	- primitives - lower level concepts, techniques or frameworks that cannot be used as a solution directly, but are used inside higher level solutions

		- Noise Protocol Framework
		- Identity solutions
	- solutions that create a virtual network by emulating the Internet protocol stack (VPNs, Wireguard, ...)
	- solutions that work on the application layer, which need a separate library to

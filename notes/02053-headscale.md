### Headscale

- Mostly the same as Tailscale, but with an open source coordination service that must be self-hosted
- Describe the differences in the deployment and how it affects usability
- We implemented a headscale based solution in order to be able to gain some insights into how they deal with peer discovery via STUN/TURN and configure Wireguard, and whether we can modify it or use parts of it in our own custom solution that is a better fit for ad hoc mpc sessions.

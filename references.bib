In some ways, IPFS is similar to the Web, but IPFS could be seen as a single BitTorrent swarm, exchanging objects within one Git repository. In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with contentaddressed hyper links. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web. IPFS combines a distributed hashtable, an incentivized block exchange, and a self-certifying namespace. IPFS has no single point of failure, and nodes do not need to trust each other.},

They can secure, in plain sight, all kinds of transactions ---such as titles, sales, and payments--- in the exact order in which they occur. Public ledgers not only curb corruption, but also enable very sophisticated applications ---such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts. They stand to revolutionize the way a democratic society operates. As currently implemented, however, they scale poorly and cannot achieve their potential. Algorand is a truly democratic and efficient way to implement a public ledger. Unlike prior implementations based on proof of work, it requires a negligible amount of computation, and generates a transaction history that will not "fork" with overwhelmingly high probability. Algorand is based on (a novel and super fast) message-passing Byzantine agreement. For concreteness, we shall describe Algorand only as a money platform.},

This leads to many problems, such as the inability to roll back changes easily, to deploy multiple versions of a package side-by-side, to reproduce a configuration deterministically on another machine, or to reliably upgrade a system. In this article we show that we can overcome these problems by moving to a purely functional system configuration model. This means that all static parts of a system (such as software packages, configuration files and system startup scripts) are built by pure functions and are immutable, stored in a way analogous to a heap in a purely functional language. We have implemented this model in NixOS, a non-trivial Linux distribution that uses the Nix package manager to build the entire system configuration from a modular, purely functional specification.},

  abstract = {WireGuard is a secure network tunnel, operating at layer 3, implemented as a kernel virtual network interface for Linux, which aims to replace both IPsec for most use cases, as well as popular user space and/or TLS-based solutions like OpenVPN, while being more secure, more performant, and easier to use. The virtual tunnel interface is based on a proposed fundamental principle of secure tunnels: an association between a peer public key and a tunnel source IP address. It uses a single round trip key exchange, based on NoiseIK, and handles all session creation transparently to the user using a novel timer state machine mechanism. Short pre-shared static keys—Curve25519 points—are used for mutual authentication in the style of OpenSSH. The protocol provides strong perfect forward secrecy in addition to a high degree of identity hiding. Transport speed is accomplished using ChaCha20Poly1305 authenticated-encryption for encapsulation of packets in UDP. An improved take on IP-binding cookies is used for mitigating denial of service attacks, improving greatly on IKEv2 and DTLS’s cookie mechanisms to add encryption and authentication. The overall design allows for allocating no resources in response to received packets, and from a systems perspective, there are multiple interesting Linux implementation techniques for queues and parallelism. Finally, WireGuard can be simply implemented for Linux in less than 4,000 lines of code, making it easily audited and verified.},

It is the first scheme for which the performance is optimal in the sense that time and communication complexity is minimal both for the individual voters and the authorities. An interesting property of the scheme is that the time and communication complexity for the voter is independent of the number of authorities. A voter simply posts a single encrypted message accompanied by a compact proof that it contains a valid vote. Our result is complementary to the result by Cramer, Franklin, Schoenmakers, and Yung in the sense that in their scheme the work for voters is linear in the number of authorities but can be instantiated to yield information-theoretic privacy, while in our scheme the voter’s effort is independent of the number of authorities but always provides computational privacy-protection. We will also point out that the majority of proposed voting schemes provide computational privacy only (often without even considering the lack of information-theoretic privacy), and that our new scheme is by far superior to those schemes.},

We present a new construction for PVSS schemes, which compared to previous solutions by Stadler and later by Fujisaki and Okamoto, achieves improvements both in efficiency and in the type of intractability assumptions. The running time is O(nk), where k is a security parameter, and n is the number of participants, hence essentially optimal. The intractability assumptions are the standard Diffie-Hellman assumption and its decisional variant. We present several applications of our PVSS scheme, among which is a new type of universally verifiable election scheme based on PVSS. The election scheme becomes quite practical and combines several advantages of related electronic voting schemes, which makes it of interest in its own right.},

  abstract = {Innføring av skivedeling i 5G nettverk åpner for at vertikale virksomheter kan utvikle og benytte sine tjenester ved siden av hverandre i telenett. Sammenliknet med tidligere generasjons mobilnettverk, søker 5G å kunne tilby flere tjenester simultant. Programvaredefinerte Nettverk (SDN) og Virtualiserte Nettverksfunksjoner (NFV) er, ved å innføre nødvendig fleksibilitet til å deployere nettverksfunksjoner og koble de sammen i ønsket rekkefølge, to hovedteknologier for å kunne lage kjeder av tjenestefunksjoner dynamisk med felles infrastruktur.     Sikkerhet er en av utfordringene med å ha en delt nettverks- og prosesseringsinfrastruktur. Tunnelering gjennom Virtuelle Private Nettverk (VPN) er et sikkerhetstiltak som kan iverksettes av den skiveansvarlige for å skille nettverksskiver, tjenester og funksjoner fra hverandre.  Vi har studert hvordan WireGuard kan brukes som VPN tilbyder for å skape en kryptert tunnel som en tjeneste mellom nettverksfunksjoner. Open Source MANO (OSM) er brukt som programvare for å kombinere og orkestrere  nettverksfunksjoner til nettverkstjenester og nettverkskiver. For å simulere reelle mobilnettverk har vi designet og testet flere scenarioer. WireGuard har blitt lagt til som VPN som en tjeneste i de ulike situasjonene for å isolere og sikre trafikken mellom nettverksfunksjoner. Gjennom utvkling i oppgaven har vi kommet opp med et konsept for å implementere en WireGuard som en tjeneste der vi bruker minimalt med manuelle steg. For å redusere manuelle steg i oppsett og konfigurasjon av WireGuard har vi brukt den innebygde Juju kontrolleren i OSM.  Etter å ha deployert nettverkstjenestene vi har utviklet til en delt infrastruktur har vi gjort målinger for å studere hvordan WireGuard påvirker ytelsen. Vi har målt en gjennomstrømning på mellom 0.8 Gbps og 2.5 Gbps og forsinkelse på under 1 ms ved bruk av WireGuard-tunneler mellom nettverksfunksjoner. Målingene vi har gjort ligger innenfor flere av nøkkeltallsindikatorene for 5G nettverk. Det gjør WireGuard passende for å brukes til å tilføre sikkerhet for isolering av nettverksskiver i utviklingen av 5G nettverk og kommende teknologier.},

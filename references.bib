In other words, IPFS provides a high throughput content-addressed block storage model, with contentaddressed hyper links. This forms a generalized Merkle DAG, a data structure upon which one can build versioned file systems, blockchains, and even a Permanent Web.

Public ledgers not only curb corruption, but also enable very sophisticated applications ---such as cryptocurrencies and smart contracts.

Algorand is a truly democratic and efficient way to implement a public ledger. Unlike prior implementations based on proof of work, it requires a negligible amount of computation, and generates a transaction history that will not "fork" with overwhelmingly high probability. Algorand is based on (a novel and super fast) message-passing Byzantine agreement. For concreteness, we shall describe Algorand only as a money platform.},

  abstract = {Existing package and system configuration management tools suffer from an imperative model, where system administration actions such as package upgrades or changes to system configuration files are stateful: they destructively update the state of the system. This leads to many problems, such as the inability to roll back changes easily, to deploy multiple versions of a package side-by-side, to reproduce a configuration deterministically on another machine, or to reliably upgrade a system. In this article we show that we can overcome these problems by moving to a purely functional system configuration model. This means that all static parts of a system (such as software packages, configuration files and system startup scripts) are built by pure functions and are immutable, stored in a way analogous to a heap in a purely functional language. We have implemented this model in NixOS, a non-trivial Linux distribution that uses the Nix package manager to build the entire system configuration from a modular, purely functional specification.},

  abstract = {WireGuard is a secure network tunnel, operating at layer 3, implemented as a kernel virtual network interface for Linux, which aims to replace both IPsec for most use cases, as well as popular user space and/or TLS-based solutions like OpenVPN, while being more secure, more performant, and easier to use. The virtual tunnel interface is based on a proposed fundamental principle of secure tunnels: an association between a peer public key and a tunnel source IP address. It uses a single round trip key exchange, based on NoiseIK, and handles all session creation transparently to the user using a novel timer state machine mechanism. Short pre-shared static keys—Curve25519 points—are used for mutual authentication in the style of OpenSSH. The protocol provides strong perfect forward secrecy in addition to a high degree of identity hiding. Transport speed is accomplished using ChaCha20Poly1305 authenticated-encryption for encapsulation of packets in UDP. An improved take on IP-binding cookies is used for mitigating denial of service attacks, improving greatly on IKEv2 and DTLS’s cookie mechanisms to add encryption and authentication. The overall design allows for allocating no resources in response to received packets, and from a systems perspective, there are multiple interesting Linux implementation techniques for queues and parallelism. Finally, WireGuard can be simply implemented for Linux in less than 4,000 lines of code, making it easily audited and verified.},

It is the first scheme for which the performance is optimal in the sense that time and communication complexity is minimal both for the individual voters and the authorities. An interesting property of the scheme is that the time and communication complexity for the voter is independent of the number of authorities. A voter simply posts a single encrypted message accompanied by a compact proof that it contains a valid vote. Our result is complementary to the result by Cramer, Franklin, Schoenmakers, and Yung in the sense that in their scheme the work for voters is linear in the number of authorities but can be instantiated to yield information-theoretic privacy, while in our scheme the voter’s effort is independent of the number of authorities but always provides computational privacy-protection. We will also point out that the majority of proposed voting schemes provide computational privacy only (often without even considering the lack of information-theoretic privacy), and that our new scheme is by far superior to those schemes.},

We present a new construction for PVSS schemes, which compared to previous solutions by Stadler and later by Fujisaki and Okamoto, achieves improvements both in efficiency and in the type of intractability assumptions. The running time is O(nk), where k is a security parameter, and n is the number of participants, hence essentially optimal. The intractability assumptions are the standard Diffie-Hellman assumption and its decisional variant. We present several applications of our PVSS scheme, among which is a new type of universally verifiable election scheme based on PVSS. The election scheme becomes quite practical and combines several advantages of related electronic voting schemes, which makes it of interest in its own right.},

  abstract = {Innføring av skivedeling i 5G nettverk åpner for at vertikale virksomheter kan utvikle og benytte sine tjenester ved siden av hverandre i telenett. Sammenliknet med tidligere generasjons mobilnettverk, søker 5G å kunne tilby flere tjenester simultant. Programvaredefinerte Nettverk (SDN) og Virtualiserte Nettverksfunksjoner (NFV) er, ved å innføre nødvendig fleksibilitet til å deployere nettverksfunksjoner og koble de sammen i ønsket rekkefølge, to hovedteknologier for å kunne lage kjeder av tjenestefunksjoner dynamisk med felles infrastruktur.     Sikkerhet er en av utfordringene med å ha en delt nettverks- og prosesseringsinfrastruktur. Tunnelering gjennom Virtuelle Private Nettverk (VPN) er et sikkerhetstiltak som kan iverksettes av den skiveansvarlige for å skille nettverksskiver, tjenester og funksjoner fra hverandre.  Vi har studert hvordan WireGuard kan brukes som VPN tilbyder for å skape en kryptert tunnel som en tjeneste mellom nettverksfunksjoner. Open Source MANO (OSM) er brukt som programvare for å kombinere og orkestrere  nettverksfunksjoner til nettverkstjenester og nettverkskiver. For å simulere reelle mobilnettverk har vi designet og testet flere scenarioer. WireGuard har blitt lagt til som VPN som en tjeneste i de ulike situasjonene for å isolere og sikre trafikken mellom nettverksfunksjoner. Gjennom utvkling i oppgaven har vi kommet opp med et konsept for å implementere en WireGuard som en tjeneste der vi bruker minimalt med manuelle steg. For å redusere manuelle steg i oppsett og konfigurasjon av WireGuard har vi brukt den innebygde Juju kontrolleren i OSM.  Etter å ha deployert nettverkstjenestene vi har utviklet til en delt infrastruktur har vi gjort målinger for å studere hvordan WireGuard påvirker ytelsen. Vi har målt en gjennomstrømning på mellom 0.8 Gbps og 2.5 Gbps og forsinkelse på under 1 ms ved bruk av WireGuard-tunneler mellom nettverksfunksjoner. Målingene vi har gjort ligger innenfor flere av nøkkeltallsindikatorene for 5G nettverk. Det gjør WireGuard passende for å brukes til å tilføre sikkerhet for isolering av nettverksskiver i utviklingen av 5G nettverk og kommende teknologier.},

  abstract = {Secure multi-party computation (MPC) allows parties to perform computations on data while keeping that data private. This capability has great potential for machine-learning applications: it facilitates training of machine-learning models on private data sets owned by different parties, evaluation of one party's private model using another party's private data, etc. Although a range of studies implement machine-learning models via secure MPC, such implementations are not yet mainstream. Adoption of secure MPC is hampered by the absence of flexible software frameworks that "speak the language" of machine-learning researchers and engineers. To foster adoption of secure MPC in machine learning, we present CrypTen: a software framework that exposes popular secure MPC primitives via abstractions that are common in modern machine-learning frameworks, such as tensor computations, automatic differentiation, and modular neural networks. This paper describes the design of CrypTen and measure its performance on state-of-the-art models for text classification, speech recognition, and image classification. Our benchmarks show that CrypTen's GPU support and high-performance communication between (an arbitrary number of) parties allows it to perform efficient private evaluation of modern machine-learning models under a semi-honest threat model. For example, two parties using CrypTen can securely predict phonemes in speech recordings using Wav2Letter faster than real-time. We hope that CrypTen will spur adoption of secure MPC in the machine-learning community.},

  abstract = {Although multiple definitions of the DevOps concept exist, DevOps is generally considered to be an Agile software development approach with the goal of combining development and operations and emphasizing frequent and fast software deployment. Four main aspects of DevOps are collaboration, automation, measurement and monitoring. While the DevOps approach offers great benefits, many companies are struggling with the implementation of DevOps and with maintaining control of their processes due to the required autonomy of the DevOps teams and the high degree of automation. At the same time, they struggle with demonstrating this control towards external auditing parties. This study therefore seeks to identify which types of risks companies using DevOps are generally exposed to and to develop a framework that helps companies control their processes and manage risks without hindering the speed and efficiency of the DevOps approach substantially. The literature review suggests that many risk management controls concerning access management, change management, compliance and security can be automated. However, research on DevOps is still scarce and specific risks applicable to DevOps are hardly mentioned. Furthermore, we conducted case studies in nine companies using DevOps which show that manners of implementing DevOps differ widely and that many companies in practice use a combination of traditional and automated controls to manage their DevOps environment. This study also shows that soft aspects such as organizational culture, communication and team responsibility are of integral importance for effectively mitigating risks in DevOps. Risks associated with DevOps can be grouped into five categories which are transitional, organizational, project, team and product risks. It is further argued that there is no best way to implement DevOps and that the DevOps concept rather needs to be tailored to the needs of the company in question. Two main factors that influence companies in their decision how to manage their processes are the DevOps maturity and risk appetite. Based on these factors, a framework is developed that suggests four strategies with suitable controls to manage risks in DevOps. The findings of this study implicate that companies first have to find a way to establish a solid DevOps culture before relying on automation practices. Likewise, auditors will have to find a way to assess these so-called "soft controls" in order to reliably give assurance on internal control. This thesis presents some first suggestions on how this can be done.},

This technique enables the construction of robust key management schemes for cryptographic systems that can function securely and reliably even when misfortunes destroy half the pieces and security breaches expose all but one of the remaining pieces.},
